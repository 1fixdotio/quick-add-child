Add child posts right from a hierarchical post editing screen.

== Description ==

By adding 2 links on the editing screen: `Add New Child` and `Add New Sibling`, just right after the `Add New` link, you can add child or sibling posts much more quickly.

The `Add New Child` and `Add New Sibling` links also appear under the "Add New" menu in the Admin Bar, so you can also create new child or sibling posts at the front-end of your WordPress website.

The `Add New Child / Sibling` link will open in a new browser tab, the plugin will select the right Parent in Page Attributes for you.

**Please note** the added links will only show on hierarchical post types.
